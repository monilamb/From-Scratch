# From Scratch

From Scratch is an app that helps people who want to know what they can cook with using ingredients they already have. This helps minimize the amount of grocery shopping the user will need to do.

It allows users to search for an ingredient and get back a list of recipes. When selecting a recipe, the recipesâ€™ ingredients are displayed in a checklist which users can check off if they already have the ingredient. The users can also save their favorite recipes and access them at a later time.

To search for recipes, type a list of ingredients in the Search bar, with each ingredient separated by a comma. The search will return the top recipes on Food2Fork that contain all of those ingredients.

Click the recipe image to go to the recipe url.

Click the heart next to a recipe to favorite it. Your favorites are accessible on the favorites tab. Clicking the image of a favorited recipe on the Favorites page returns that recipe from Food2Fork.
